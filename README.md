### More about the project:
We're 6 UCSB students in the Data Science Collaborative who wanted to dedicate time to a fun project that would help us develop our skills.
As such an integral part of our campus and pretty much our secondary mascot, we decided that tracking the location of raccoons across campus 
would be a fun undertaking. This is a basic website to begin with, but we're hoping to create heat maps of raccoon hotspots, a leaderboard
of who has had the most raccoon sightings, and more!
